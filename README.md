Control the podcast played in my phone, laptops through my voice input. Stop, Rewind, Take note at that point seperately and continue.



### Potential Learning curve to building this 



1)  General Project Structure planning

    - Working with a makefile    
    - Test, linters, style formatter, documentation, version    control ...

2) Technical Aspect

    - What does it mean to understand sound .. 
    - Basics of Audio processing
    - Could the problem be simpler in my case .. Could simple digital electornics get me by ?
    - Deep learning to understand patterns 


    Still, this is a work in progress ...
